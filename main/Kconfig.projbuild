            help
                The GPIO number of the pin for transmitting serial data to the target.
                Note that GPIOs 34-39 can only be used as inputs.

                The GPIO number of the pin connected to the RESET pin of the target.
                Note that GPIOs 34-39 can only be used as inputs.

            range 0 33
            help
                The GPIO number of the pin that is connected to the power on/off pin of the target, if it has one.
                Note that GPIOs 34-39 can only be used as inputs.

                Connect a push-button for this GPIO number to force the ESP into AP mode to allow reconfiguring it.
                The default pin is connected to the BOOT button on the ESP32-devkit.
